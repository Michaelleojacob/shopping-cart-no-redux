attempting to pass state without redux (outlet and context)

This app was to see if I could pass state around in react-router-dom without redux.

-> successful: use Outlet context={} + useOutletContext();

And practice react-router-dom gh-pages deployment

-> also successful. HashRouter is mentioned here: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/ So I guess I use HashRouter, and it works lol.
